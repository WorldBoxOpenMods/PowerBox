# PowerBox

PowerBox is a QoL mod made for WorldBox using NML as its modloader which focuses on adding many of the most widely demanded QoL features by the community to teh game in a highly stable way.

## Building

The project, as uploaded on this repo, cannot be built out of the box. It assumes that all of it's dependency DLLs like NML and a publicised Assembly-CSharp.dll file are located within a Libraries directory in the parent directory of PowerBox.
Note that being able to build it isn't necessary for loading the mod into your game, since NML compiles mods on the fly.
